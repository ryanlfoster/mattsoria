	            When I was in college I was taking an advanced digital photography class with <a href="http://siberart.com/" target="_blank">Matt Siber</a> which was all about the digital process — digital capture, RAW processing, Photoshop and manipulation, and printing. Anyway, I recall Matt giving a demo one day and plugging in one of his external hard drives, and someone pointed out that when the icon for the hard drive appeared on the desktop, which was projected on the wall, it was labeled with an interesting name. I don't remember exactly what it was, but he explained that he had gotten in the habit of naming all of his hard drives based on a naming scheme. I want to say it was classical composers or something like that. So this particular hard drive might have been named <em>Beethoven</em>, and another might have been <em>Chopin</em>, and so on (my knowledge of classical composers is pretty limited).
</p>
<p>
	            I really liked this idea, and decided to start naming my own hard drives and devices based on a theme too. I immediately turned to one of my favorite musical groups: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament-Funkadelic" target="_blank">Parliament-Funkadelic</a> (better known as <em>P-Funk</em>, or deeper still <em>The Mothership Connection</em>). In my mind it was the perfect source for a naming scheme because they have tons of characters, made-up words, and even their own folklore within their music an lyrics. That was probably around five years ago, and I've gathered a handful of hard drives and devices since then, and continue to follow the P-Funk naming scheme.

<p>
	          Here's what I've got so far (links will open in new tab):
</p>
<ul>
	<li>2TB External Drive — <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3bleXWaCk" target="_blank">MaggotBrain</a></li>
	<li>1TB External Drive — <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkBHwY5xVCc">Bopgun</a></li>
	<li>1TB External Drive — <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0a1d9V_9js">Cholly</a></li>
	<li>13" Macbook Pro — <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT3ecv01xDE" target="_blank">Starchild</a></li>
	<li>Old Dell Laptop — <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBAF3NNYAW4&amp;feature=kp" target="_blank">Funkentelechy</a></li>
	<li>1.5TB Portable Drive — <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBVNOrV0Pr4&amp;feature=kp" target="_blank">Aquaboogie</a></li>
	<li>500GB Portable Drive — <a href="http://youtu.be/uQFGkGk4PSc?t=9m14s" target="_blank">Mothership</a></li>
	<li>4GB Thumb Drive — <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQFYJXMVxTc" target="_blank">Uncle Jam</a><a href="http://youtu.be/uQFGkGk4PSc?t=9m14s" target="_blank"></a></li>
	<li>iPod Touch 5 — <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qXuMdQLwkQ" target="_blank">Freak of the Week</a></li>
	<li>iPad 2 — <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gTLxgssOXI" target="_blank">Sir Nose</a> (I intentionally named this after the lame, unfunky dude from P-Funk folklore because, come on, they're kinda dorky)</li>
	<li>iPhone 3 — <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isp-LLFCiyQ" target="_blank">Unfunky UFO</a></li>
	<li>iPod Classic — Funkblaster (this one's the only one that's not  technically a P-Funk reference, but I named it before I started doing  this)<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isp-LLFCiyQ" target="_blank"></a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	   And this is what the sidebar in my finder window looks like sometimes:
</p>

</p>
<p>
	   It's just kind of fun, but it's also actually kind of useful (<a href="http://namingschemes.com/" target="_blank">and apparently a real thing</a>). I reorganize the contents of the drives from time-to-time, but for the most part I start to recognize what I'm looking for based on its funky name. I've even got a little piece of tape labeled with the name of the drive on each of the cables to keep things organized, and so I know which drive I'm plugging in.

<p>
	   Because most hard drives and devices have a character limit when naming I'm kind of limited as to what I can choose (otherwise I'd have a device named <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wL1NyqLs5E" target="_blank">Promentalshitbackwashpsychosis</a> already), and I think eventually I'll have to start dipping into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clinton_%28musician%29" target="_blank">George Clinton</a>'s solo work (I've been really tempted with using "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuyS9M8T03A" target="_blank">Atomic Dog</a>"), but I'm going to try and keep it going as long as I can.
</p>
<p>
	   I'm also curious to hear if anyone else uses a naming scheme for their devices and hard drives, and if <em>you</em> do, <strong>please share what it is in a comment!</strong>
