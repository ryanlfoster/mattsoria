</p>
<p>
	   I was recently contacted by a very nice person who was looking to  have a website designed and built for her brand, and after asking her  some questions about the project I determined that it wasn't really the  right project for me based on the scale and budget. This happens pretty  regularly, and I don't mind it. I look at it as an opportunity to help  out friends of mine who are just starting connect with clients that have  projects that are more suited for someone like them.
</p>
<p>
	     After referring her to a friend of mine who I thought would be a good  fit for the project she thanked me and asked if I could share some  insight on pricing, help her understand where rates come from, and maybe  offer some advice on what she should know when contacting web  professionals with inquiries for work.
</p>
<p>
	     I thought about it for a little while, and was trying to come up with  a more common experience that was similar to hiring a web designer when  I thought of the Auto Mechanic analogy. The following is what I ended  up responding to her email with.
</p>
<p>
	 <strong>Note</strong>: Throughout the response I frequently use the term <em>Web Designer</em>,  but I'm really using it to cover any sort of freelance web professional  — designer, developer, or any other specialist. For me these questions  are usually referring to hiring a person that is going to handle  everything from design to development, but I think that the following  explanation could be applied to <strong>any</strong> type of freelancer, not just one working in the web industry.
</p>
<h3> Shopping for an Auto Mechanic</h3>
<p>
	     I know <strong>nothing</strong> about cars - absolutely nothing. So  when my car breaks and I have to take it into an Auto Mechanic I have no  idea what it’s going to cost. I hope for the best, and usually end up  with a number in my head that is way lower than it actually ends up  costing. This is what I think it is probably like for people who are  looking to have a website made for the first time.
</p>
<p>
	     I think there is sometimes this notion that when you take your car to  an Auto Mechanic they are going to charge you for all sorts of things  you don’t need, and overcharge you for the things you do need. The work  being done largely happens behind closed doors, so it's hard to know  exactly how much, and what kind of work is actually going on. I think  people looking for websites sometimes have that same notion. A shady,  dishonest Auto Mechanic will probably try to pull that stuff on you, and  unfortunately there are Web Designers and agencies out there that do  the same thing — overcharge you for their time, and sell you things you  don’t need. But, as I’m sure it is in the Auto Mechanic Industry, a good  Web Designer or agency will be honest and open with you about how they  are charging for their services, and will be well worth the money you  spend on them — <strong>these are the people you want to hire</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	     Likewise I am sure there are Auto Mechanics out there that advertise  an insanely low price for their services, and you might think to  yourself, “This is great! I’ll get out of this thing for just a couple  hundred bucks!”, but when your car craps out on the expressway a week  later you’re going to really regret your hasty decision. The same goes  for websites. There are a million companies and people offering  dirt-cheap website services that are going to seem really appealing on  paper, but when your website looks like crap, doesn’t function right, is  difficult to update, and fails to attract the attention of the audience  you are looking to retain, you’re going to regret going to the  PSD-to-HTML-in-one-hour guy.
</p>
<p>
	     Of course, it all depends on what you need. Even for a person who  knows nothing about cars (sorry for the persistent analogy), I could  watch a tutorial on YouTube on how to change the oil in my car and do it  myself for free, or if I get a flat tire while on the road I’m sure I  could manage to get the spare on — it will take me a longer to do it  than someone who knows what they are doing, but I could manage. <strong>The awesome thing about the web is that it’s a self-perpetuating mechanism</strong>.  All of the people working in the web industry learn what they know from  the web itself, and share what they’ve learned with the web community,  who in turn learn, innovate and share, and so on. All of the information  on how to do what we do as web professionals is out there for anyone to  learn, so if there is something minor you need done, chances are there  is a thorough tutorial out there explaining exactly how to do that  thing, so go for it!
</p>
<p>
	     The majority of people out there are scared of screwing up, and don't  have the time it takes to really learn what you need to know in order  to get the job done right. That's why I take my car to an Auto Mechanic.  It also takes a person with a certain way of thinking to even be  interested in learning how to do these things in the first place. Those  people become Auto Mechanics or Web Designers, and you want to hire  them.
</p>
<h3> What You Should Know</h3>
<p>
	 <strong>Every project, and every web designer is different</strong>.  There is no international standard for pricing web design services to  reference, so finding the right person to hire for your project that  fits your budget is going to require some homework on your part. First  of all, what I suggest to anyone looking to hire a Web Designer, is to  have answers to as many of the following questions as possible ready to  provide anyone that you submit an inquiry to:
</p>
<p>
	 <strong>1) Time-frame</strong> — No matter what the project is, no  matter what the budget is, if your time-frame doesn’t work for the  person you’re looking to hire then the rest is pretty much irrelevant.
</p>
<p>
	 <strong>2) Objectives</strong> — What is the purpose of your project?  Why do you need a website in the first place? You need to determine  what it is you want your website to do. If it is simply a one-page site  that has the goal of displaying your contact information to potential  employers then that is going shape the rest of the process a lot  differently than it would if you need an e-commerce site for your <a href="http://www.figurerealm.com/viewcustomfigures.php?op=3&amp;id=572">handmade horror film action figures</a>, right?
</p>
<p>
	 <strong>3) Project Scope</strong> — Have an idea about what services  you need, how large the project will be, and what technologies it might  involve. A lot of times people looking to hire a Web Designer have never  done it before, and don’t really know what their project is going to  entail, which is fine. That’s part of what you hire a professional for —  to help guide you through the process and explain what is needed to  make your project a reality. But do some research. Google around for  examples, and read about what was involved in making some websites that  serve a similar purpose. Just remember to take everything you read with a  grain of salt, and ultimately the person you hire will help you sort  through it. There are a lot of fluffy, sensational articles out there  that will misguide you into believing silly things.
</p>
<p>
	 <strong>4) Budget</strong> — Money is uncomfortable to talk about for  most of us, clients and service providers alike, but if you’re going to  be spending money on a website then you have to have a budget, and the  person you’re going to pay needs to know what it is in order to  determine if it is a worth-while project for them to take on, or how to  adjust the scope of the project to fit your budget and their skills.
</p>
<p>
	 <strong>5) Content</strong> — Depending on your situation, you might  actually be hiring the person or agency to help write your content, but  if not you need to have some ready to work with. This doesn’t  necessarily mean you need to have the entire architecture of your site  already solidified, with every word set in stone, but you do need to  have some of it on hand in order to give the designer something real to  work with. Everyone’s process is different, but I think that you, your  end product, and your experience with the person you hire will be much  more beneficial if you have some real content to use as a foundation for  the rest of project.
</p>
<p>
	     If you have all of those things ready to discuss with the person you  are looking to hire you're going to save a lot of time, and probably  show the web designer that you're going to be a good client. <em>Please</em>,  don't mistake this to mean that you should compile your list and copy  and paste it into an email to 50 different designers and send it off.  I'd be really turned off if I received an email with all that in it as  the first form of contact. In the first email, or phone call, it would  probably be helpful to introduce yourself, your project, a bit about  where you found this designer and why you think they might be a good fit  to work on it with you, and the time-frame (again, if that doesn't fit  then the rest doesn't matter so much). After you establish contact and  the designer expresses interest, you can bust out your list.
</p>
<h3> The Contract</h3>
<p>
	     I'm no lawyer, but I know from experience that you should <strong>absolutely</strong> be signing a contract when hiring a Web Designer — <strong>period</strong>.  It is for the benefit of both of you because it makes sure that both  parties are aware of the terms on which they are agreeing to work, and  it shows that you both have each others' best interests at heart.
</p>
<p>
	     Chances are the person you are looking to hire is going to have their  own contract, and I recommend you use it because it is probably  specifically catered to the type of work they do, but if they make no  mention of a contract when you begin discussing project details, you're  going to want to ask: "Do you have a contract?". If they don't have a  contract for you to sign, then you should ask them to draft one up (a  great place for them to start would be <a href="https://gist.github.com/malarkey/4031110">Andrew Clarke's Contract Killer</a>),  but if they tell you it's not necessary then you should probably put  one together yourself that just outlines the basic terms of the project:  time-frame, payment schedule, deliverables, etc. If you have a lawyer  then have them help you, but I really don't think it is necessary. As  long as you state what you have probably already agreed to while  discussing the project, and sign it, then you at least have a legal  document to refer to if any of the terms come into question.
</p>
<h3> Yeah great, but what should I expect to pay?</h3>
<p>
	     I'm afraid I'm going to have to disappoint you with this answer.  There really is no way to give an accurate answer. Each project and  designer vary on a pretty large scale, and it's pretty hard to put a  price on a "generic" project. It all comes down to how much work is  involved in your project, and how the designer charges for their  services.
</p>
<p>
	     Personally, I like to think of projects in terms of how much they  will cost as a whole based on an hourly rate, and an estimate of how  much time the project will take to complete, with some room for  unexpected needed time. I like to explain this to the client so they  understand exactly how they are being charged, and where I am getting  these absurd numbers from. I know that some web designers charge a day  rate, others charge by the week, but I choose to charge by the hour  because it is easier for me to understand the value of the time I spend  working in small chunks like that. Don't be afraid to ask your Web  Designer how they break down their rate.
</p>
<p>
	     I'll be open: right now my freelance rate is $100/hr. It depends on  who reads that number, but I'm guessing for a lot of people it sounds  unreasonably high. I'd like to explain how I got to that amount though,  and hopefully it will seem more reasonable, because it is based on some  real considerations.
</p>
<p>
	     Right now I am putting in 40 hours a week working as a contracted  Front-end Developer for a design studio, and any freelance I do is on  top of that 40 hours. As much as I enjoy working as a Web Designer,  there are a lot more things in life that I enjoy even more, and I need  to be able to spend time doing them. For a while I was picking up small  freelance projects on the side, and charging very little for them for  various reasons (mainly that I have a hard time saying "no"), but after a  while I realized that these projects were taking up what little free  time I had, and really that free time was far more valuable than the  time that I have allotted as "work time". Any time that I spend working  instead of indulging in my other passions, or spending time with people I  care about should be the most valuable time of all, so if I'm going to  work on a project instead of spend time with those other things, it's  really got to be worth it!
</p>
<p>
	     Another way I came up with $100 is that I considered how much money I  currently make a month, which is enough to pay my bills, loans, and  save a little, and thought about maintaining that amount based on a  hypothetical scenario. The scenario being: what if the contract I'm  working on is suddenly terminated, and I no longer have that income and  need to turn to freelancing full-time, <em>and</em> if that's the case,  and I'm only able to land one substantial job a month, how much would I  have to charge to maintain that monthly salary? The rough answer is $100  per hour.
</p>
<p>
	     The last factor that determined my current rate: <strong>I am worth it</strong>.  It took me a long time to be able to say that confidently, and even  still, I was just barely able to type out the word "confidently" with  confidence. But I worked for three years charging at $20-25/hr, and  building websites for people at a flat rate of $300, some of which I  spent up to 60 hours on (that comes out to $5/hr) — all because I was  afraid to talk about money, embarrassed to charge what I thought I was  worth, and was afraid to say no. This isn't a unique experience by any  means, and in fact, might be somewhat of a rite of passage for Web  Designers, because charging for something that is sort of intangible is  weird, and it's hard to see the benefit sometimes. But it is becoming  more and more apparent that a website is extremely valuable, and the  knowledge, skills, time, and insight that web professionals provide as a  service are in high demand. I'd also like to point out that this is  only my rate, so please don't assume that this is the "norm" or an  average rate for the industry; and also that rates change all the time  based on a number of different variables.
</p>
<p>
	     I can't speak for anyone else, but for me that rate isn't tattooed on  my forehead, and I am more than willing to adjust my rate, or at least  the overall price for a complete project, based on the needs of a client  if I feel that it's a project I'd really like to work on — and I'd  really like to work on a lot of projects! I came up with my rate to  allow myself a little wiggle room so that if I'm in a crunch, I can  afford to negotiate a rate that is a little smaller. There are always  limits to what a freelancer can actually afford to do depending on their  current financial status, because a lot of times <strong>bills just need to get paid</strong>,  but there is usually room negotiation. A more common form of  negotiation that you might encounter when working with Web Designers is  to adjust the scope of the project and the work involved to meet your  project's budget. So if you have a budget of $4,000, but the Web  Designer estimates that the work involved in making your project happen  is actually worth $5,000 (based on time and their hourly rate), then  instead of saying, "Sorry, this isn't going to work!", you can discuss  ways to simplify the project or cut unneeded features to get the project  down to something worth $4,000, <em>and</em> if the Web Designer gets  to the end of the project and finds that they haven't quite used up  $4,000 worth of their time, they can always add in some of those extra  things that were cut out.
</p>
<p>
	     The point here is to <strong>be flexible</strong> on the scope of your project, and the Web Designer will probably be willing to work with you on it.
</p>
<h3> Yeah great, but my budget is really small...</h3>
<p>
	     So you've browsed around the internet for some great Web Designers,  because any project worth doing is worthy of a great Designer and a  great website, but after sending out some emails to the owners of some  of the most impressive portfolios you found on <a href="http://www.awwwards.com/websites/portfolio/">Awwwards</a> you are finding that their rates are way more than your budget can afford...<strong>bummer</strong>. But don't get discouraged! Really, don't — some of the biggest websites online today had humble beginnings (<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/6125914/How-20-popular-websites-looked-when-they-launched.html">check 'em out</a>),  and if your budget is really small then chances are whatever it is you  need a website for is just starting out, or is simple enough to not  require a huge budget.
</p>
<p>
	     As the saying goes "you get what you pay for", and I think that is  mostly true in the web industry as well, but it doesn't mean that having  a small budget is going to yield a crappy website. A lot of what you  pay for is experience and knowledge, so if you have a small budget then  expect to hire someone with less experience and knowledge — <em>hire someone that is just starting out</em>!  It's the perfect compromise for someone with a small budget. You might  not get the same results as someone with years of experience, and it  might take a little longer for them to get it done, but in my experience  Web Designers that are just starting out work twice as hard as some of  the more experienced professionals, and are willing to put in the extra  time and effort it takes to meet your expectations, regardless of the  budget, because they want to meet the challenge and gain the experience  (and also because a lot of times they  are the ones that can actually  afford to invest that much time into something even if it isn't going to  pay well).
</p>
<p>
	     This doesn't mean you should go out and find some kid that is just  starting out, take advantage of the fact that they don't have a family  and mortgage to pay for, have them build the Taj Mahal of websites, and  pay 'em $100 for it. <strong>Be honest, and be realistic</strong>. That should go without saying, but one of the biggest frustrations I had when starting out was working with clients that had <em>tiny</em> budgets and <em>huge</em>  ideas and expectations. Be a good client by understanding that your  project is not the number one priority in any web designers life, <strong>ever</strong>,  no matter how much you're paying them, and especially if you are paying  them very little. If you are understanding, and you work with the  rookie Web Designer through what is most likely a learning experience  for you both, then you are going to get a decent site, and you will have  helped the rookie gain some very valuable experience.
</p>
<p>
	     The best advice I can give you to help you find a cheap web designer  is to look at your local college, or even high school. Get on their  website and find out who teaches any web design (or related) classes.  You can email them and let them know you are looking to hire one of  their students for your project, and my guess is that the teacher will  probably be thrilled to give one of her students the opportunity to gain  some real life experience in what they are teaching, and will probably  refer you to her best student. The school might even have a "talent  board" on which students and alumni can post their contact information,  and list the services they are looking to get hired for. <a href="http://talent.colum.edu/">Mine did</a>, and I still get emails from people who found me there.
</p>
<p>
	     If this is the route you end up taking, then I applaud you for  helping advance the web industry by working with the people that will  soon be making the decisions, and doing the work that will push it  forward in the future, <strong><em>but</em></strong> I do have some  hopes that I would like to voice on their behalf — after all, I was one  of them not to long ago, and I care about them a lot.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Even if they are still students; even if it's your 14-year-old niece — <strong>treat them as a professional</strong>.  They are probably trying very hard to break into the industry and gain  some experience, and treating them as a professional will offer them a  more realistic experience and help prepare them for the professional  world. They also still deserve your respect, and treating them as an  equal, as well as a person knowledgeable in an area that you are not, is  just the right thing to do.</li>
	<li> <strong>Have them sign a contract</strong>. Even if it's their first  job, and even if you're only paying them a very small amount, it will  still benefit you both if anything should happen, will be good practice  for you both, and get you in the habbit of doing what you should be  doing on any other projects to come.</li>
	<li> <strong>Pay them fairly</strong>. Even though they might be starting  out, they are still providing a special service in a trade that is in  very high demand, and are probably providing an arguably invaluable  asset to your business or brand (or whatever), so compensate them  appropriately. Again, it's difficult to put a number on something with  so many variables, but if the person thinks they will need to spend 40  hours to complete your project, and you figure you might pay them at  $20/hour, which is <strong>insanely</strong> cheap, then you are still  looking at $800 for the whole project. You should almost never be  spending less than that on a website. That is absolutely dirt-cheap.  That said, I definitely did a handful of sites for just a few hundred  dollars when I was starting out, but looking back I really should have  been charging much more, even though I was just starting out.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tldr"> The Bottom Line (tldr)</h3>
<p>
	     Every project is different, and every Web Designer is different, so  there isn't an industry standard for how much a site will cost. Do your  research, know what it is you are looking for, and look at examples.  Have a budget and be open and honest about it when talking with Web  Designers. When you do contact someone with an inquiry, have your  project objectives, scope, budget, and ideally even some content ready  to talk about. If you have a very tight budget look into hiring someone  with less experience, but treat them with the same level of respect and  professionalism that you would if you were working with <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/about/">Jeffrey Zeldman</a> himself, and pay them fairly. <strong>Sign a contract</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	     The person who contacted me with the question finished her email by saying,
</p>
<blockquote>
	       "if you don't ask, you'll never know."
</blockquote>
<p>
	    I thought that it was the perfect sentiment for this whole  discussion, and maybe the most important point I could impress upon  someone that's looking to hire a Web Designer. You aren't expected to be  an expert on this stuff — that's why you're hiring a web professional —  so if you're not sure about something, <strong>just ask</strong>!
</p>
<h3> Resources</h3>

<p>
	     If you've got the budget, and you're doing things right, then  you'll be choosing a Web Designer because they seem like the right  person for the job, as opposed to the cheapest, or the most available.  If this is the case then you should start talking to friends and  colleages and get some references for good Web Designers they've worked  with, and browse some of these sites for talent that seem like a good  fit:
