summary: "I've got ten fingers, but there's only one mouse pointer! How do I simulate touch gestures in the iOS simulator that comes with Xcode?"

<p>
	  I was working on a site today and needed to test it for iOS, so I was using the iOS simulator that comes with Xcode to test it for iPhone when I ran into a situation where I needed to simulate a touch gesture - in this case, a "pinch and zoom." That's when I realized I had never tried doing it before, and I didn't know how the hell it was done!
</p>
<p>
	  A quick search revealed that all you need to do is hold down the <code class="lang-markup">CTL</code> key, which will bring up two little gray circles that represent your fingers, and then click and drag to simulate the pinch or zoom - that's it!

	  The screenshot above shows how it might look if you're visiting the Mr. Bean site, which is not responsive because Mr. Bean isn't as concerned about web accessibility as much as he is about his teddy, getting a good parking spot, or getting new toys for Christmas.

	  This is a super short post because I decided for little things like this that I end up having to Google all the time, I'd rather post them here for my own (and your) sake. That way it's here, and writing this blog post hopefully engrained it in my memory a little more. So there will probably be a lot of short posts with just a little code snippet or tip related to computer-stuffs.
