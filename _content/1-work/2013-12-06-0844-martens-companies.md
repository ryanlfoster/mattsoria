about: |
  <p>
  	 Based in Wichita, Kansas, the Martens Companies is made up by five commercial real estate specialty companies. Together they are able to provide their clients with the most in-depth, up-to-date commercial real estate expertise. Each of the individual companies already had their own websites, but they needed a central location that unified them, and could be used as a hub to direct the client to the service they were searching for.

  	 <a href="http://entermotion.com" target="_blank">Entermotion</a>'s design team laid out a very simple and beautiful design  that really makes the five companies feel like they belong under the  same, trustworthy roof. The design was then handed to me to code, and I took the liberty of adjusting their simple layout so that it flows naturally no matter what size screen a potential client views it on. Using Sass/Compass, along with some simple-but-handy css tricks I was able to cut down on the amount images that were intended to be used, and make the site just a little faster.
