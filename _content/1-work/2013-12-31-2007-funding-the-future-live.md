  <p>
  	  Funding The Future Live is an event hosted by the members of the band <a href="http://Using the power of a live rock performance and our own personal story, “Funding The Future” inspires young people with lessons of finance and discipline to help them see their own dreams as possibilities." target="_blank"><em>Gooding</em></a> that uses the power of a live rock performance and their own personal storyto inspire young people with lessons of finance and discipline to help them see their own dreams as possibilities. They were in need of a website to share information about the event and to illustrate the impact it can have on its young audience through video, images, and written testimonials. They came to <a href="http://entermotion.com" target="_blank">Entermotion</a> to design and build a responsive website that would look and work great while showcasing the work they've done.

  	  The design team at Entermotion created a killer design for the project that really fit the look and feel of the band and the event. I was given the design mockups and tasked with coding the front-end for the project. I built the site on top of a custom content management system that was provided by the back-end team at Entermotion, and using Sass and Compass, created a front-end structure that is intuitive an easy to maintain.

  <p>
  	  As with many responsive projects, I was given the opportunity to take a bit of creative interpretation when it came to adjusting the layout based on the size it is being viewed at. The layout throughout the site is pretty simple, but I created a very small and useful set of grid classes in order to easily handle the adjustments. The result is a site that looks and works great, is easy to maintain thanks to the CMS, and was a pleasure to work on!
