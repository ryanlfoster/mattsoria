<h4>The <a href="http://www.appalachianglobalservicecorps.org">Appalachian Global Service Corps</a>, a non-profit organization based in Kentucky, asked me to create a logo for them to help with their identity and fundraising.</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;">
	 <img src="/_themes/mattsoria/img/work/agsc_logos.jpg">
</p>
<p>
	          I created a composition that highlighted some key characteristics and values of the organization, like its connection to the Appalachian Mountains, and it's mission to help in both physical and educational capacities. I also created some variations of the mark to be used in various scenarios.
