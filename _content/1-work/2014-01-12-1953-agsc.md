about: |
  <p>
  	  The <a href="http://www.appalachianglobalservicecorps.org/">Appalachian Global Service Corps</a> is a non-profit organization based in the Appalachian Mountains of Southeastern Kentucky, dedicated to developing global citizenship, leadership skills, and  language abilities of Appalachian youth through life-altering service  learning. Preceding a funding campaign to help 15 students travel to Peru for two weeks of experiential service and a cultural immersion experience, they approached me to design a logo that would help unify their identity and express their mission.

  	  I worked together with the founders of the organization to identify various visuals and themes that would help portray both the organization's roots, as well as its mission. I presented them with a series of sketches and ideas, and we narrowed down the visuals to what was really important to express through the logo. Inspired by various scout badges from the 50's and 60's, I created a circular composition that includes the rolling peaks of the Appalachian Mountains, a shining sun, and a cross made up of a shovel and pencil, to symbolize the physical and academic efforts of the organization and its volunteers. I reworked some of the main elements of the logo into various compositions to be used in a multitude of scenarios.
