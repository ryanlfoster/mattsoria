about: |
  <p>
  	       Atlas.md is a new <strong>EMR</strong> web application built by the awesome team at Entermotion that was designed to make managing patient records, appointments, prescriptions and communication easy for health care practices and doctors. The goal of the app is to simplify the hassle of all the paperwork involved in healthcare, and let doctors focus on what really matters: caring for their patients. The sales site for Atlas.md is responsible for conveying the many ways in which the app will benefit medical practices that adopt its usage, and for onboarding new users. The site highlights various features of the application to help potential users understand the breadth of its capabilities, not to mention how great it looks!

  	       I was tasked with building out the front-end code for the sales site, which presented many interesting challenges to overcome. The design team created a beautiful layout that highlights various features of the app, and illustrates its capabilities to be used on any device or screen size. This yielded very specific layouts in each section that required me to do some creative coding and problem solving in order to make it fully responsive - which it is. The large images and screenshots used to show off the app's great design were quite large and heavy, especially when serving higher resolution versions for retina displays, so I needed to employ some responsive image techniques to ensure that the site loads quickly no matter what you're viewing it on.
