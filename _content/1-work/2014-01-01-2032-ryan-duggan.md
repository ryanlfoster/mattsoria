<h4>I was hired by Ryan Duggan, an awesome artist known well in Chicago and beyond for his hand-lettering, concert posters, and skateboard company <em>Hated</em>, to redesign his website.</h4>
<p>
	       Ryan was maintaining his own site in static HTML files pieced together with Adobe Dreamweaver, and with a portfolio of work that was constantly being added to, he wanted a better way to add projects and maintain the site. We sat down together and sketched out some ideas, and came up with a design that showcased the work and fit his style. I built out a custom, responsive theme for Wordpress, which made it easy for him to add projects to, and update.
</p>
<p>
	To display the projects in his portfolio we decided to display thumbnails in a grid, with details and more images on individual project pages.
