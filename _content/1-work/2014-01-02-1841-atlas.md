<h4>Atlas.md is a new EMR (electronic medical record) web application built by an awesome team at <a href="http://www.entermotion.com">Entermotion</a>, and I was assigned with the front-end work for the sales site.</h4>
<p>
	      The design team came up with a great layout that really highlights the app's many features, and  it was my job to make their design look and function great, wherever and however it was viewed.
</p>
<p>
	      The design called for some very specific layouts for each section, in order to call attention to various features and aspects of the app, so coding the site responsively was a challenge - but I came up with some great ways to handle the flow of the layout no matter what size screen it was viewed on.
