  ## Colophon
  
  This site was built in December, 2013, by me.
  
  The fonts I used are [Rooney Web](http://www.janfromm.de/typefaces/rooney/web/) and [Europa](http://www.europatype.com/articledetail/17), and are hosted with [Typekit](https://typekit.com/).
  
  The icons were generated using [Icomoon](http://icomoon.io).
  
  I used [Sass](http://www.sass-lang.org) with [Compass](http://www.compass-style.org) to pre-process my css, and coded in [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com).
  
  I used [Grunt](http://www.grunt.js) to handle the automation of minifying and concatenating my js files, and image compression.
  
  The site is running on [Statamic](http://www.statamic.com), a static site generator.
  
  I have put the site's code on a [public Github repo](https://github.com/poopsplat/mattsoria), so feel free to take a look, and make suggestions.

### I enjoy working on projects that are **fun** and **challenging**.

### Here are a few interesting things about me:

- I have lived in and around the city of **Chicago** (USA) my whole life, until I moved to **Valparaiso, Chile** in July of 2013 - where I'm currently living and working. I made a blog called [Permiso Valparaiso](http://permisovalparaiso.com) that I occasionally update with photos, and thoughts about my experiences here.

- I studied **photography** in college, and though I still enjoy photography, I'm not pursing a career in it.

- I used to **teach** an after-school photography class at a high school in Chicago.

- My online moniker is **Poopsplat** - it has been since 2010. It started out just as a silly name when I created my first blog at Poopsplat.com (on hiatus), and it just stuck. Friends call me "Poops", "Poopers" or "Poopies".

- I have been working the past several years in various full-time, and contract positions as a Web Designer/Front-end Developer, as well as **freelancing** - which I'd like to get back into eventually.

- My dream job would combine these passions: **art/design, skateboarding, youth education, international comradery**
