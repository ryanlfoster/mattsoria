  ## Colophon
  
  This site was built in December, 2013, by me.
  
  The fonts I used are [Rooney Web](http://www.janfromm.de/typefaces/rooney/web/) and [Europa](http://www.europatype.com/articledetail/17), and are hosted with [Typekit](https://typekit.com/).
  
  The icons were generated using [Icomoon](http://icomoon.io).
  
  I used [Sass](http://www.sass-lang.org) with [Compass](http://www.compass-style.org) to pre-process my css, and coded in [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com).
  
  The site is running on [Statamic](http://www.statamic.com), an awesome, dynamic flat-file CMS built on PHP.
  
  I use [Deploy](http://www.deployhq.com) to handle deployment from Github.
  
  I have put the site's code on a [public Github repo](https://github.com/poopsplat/mattsoria), so feel free to take a look, and make suggestions.

    ## What I Do
    I work with clients or teams to create beautiful, interesting and effective designs for the web, and build those designs on top of a solid (but responsive) foundation of scalable, semantic, and [future-friendly](http://futurefriendlyweb.com/thinking.html) code.
  
    ##How I Do It
    Whether I'm designing or developing, I am foremost a critical thinker, and approach every project with an open mind and the drive to get the very best results. I don't pretend to know everything, and indeed believe that my willingness to explore new and unknown concepts is one of my greatest strengths. To me, every project is a new opportunity to learn, and improve my craft.
    I know the importance of effective communication — whether working on a team, or one-on-one with a client — and I value it as much as you do. Honesty is my priority when it comes to building a relationship with anyone I work with. I like to operate with complete transparency, so we can trust that we are always on the same page.
    With each project I work on I do
  
    ### Also, I make it my mission to find the fun in everything I do.

    ## A little background
  
    - I have lived in and around the city of Chicago (USA) my whole life, until I moved to Valparaiso, Chile in July of 2013 - where I'm currently living and working. I made a blog called Permiso Valparaiso that I occasionally update with photos, and thoughts about my experiences here.
  
    - I studied photography in college, and though I still enjoy photography, I'm not pursing a career in it.
  
    - I used to teach an after-school photography class at a high school in Chicago.
  
    - My online moniker is Poopsplat - it has been since 2010. It started out just as a silly name when I created my first blog at Poopsplat.com (on hiatus), and it just stuck. Friends call me "Poops", "Poopers" or "Poopies".
  
     - I have been working the past several years in various full-time, and contract positions as a Web Designer/Front-end Developer, as well as freelancing - which I still do occasionally.
  
    - I got my start in web design when I was around 13 years old and discovered Yahoo Geocities, where I made many sites for my friends and I to post pictures and videos of us skateboarding.
  
    - My favorite movie is _Hook_, my favorite book is _Ishmael_, and my favorite day is Halloween.
  
     - My dream job would combine these passions: art/design, skateboarding, youth education, international comradery

  ## What I Do
  I work with clients or teams to create beautiful, interesting and effective designs for the web, and build those designs on top of a solid (but responsive) foundation of scalable, semantic, and [future-friendly](http://futurefriendlyweb.com/thinking.html) code.
  
  I consider myself a **Front-end** Developer, which means I spend most of my time writing in **HTML**, **CSS** (Sass actually), and **JavaScript** (jQuery is my flavor), but I also spend a bit of time working with **PHP**. A website will get really stale, really fast if you can't edit or add to it, so I build sites for **content management systems** (CMS) like [WordPress](http://wordpress.org), [Statamic](http://statamic.com), and [Perch](http://grabaperch.com), which are my current favorites, but I will work with any CMS that best fits your project's needs.
