	       The template I use to make starting front-end projects fast and easy. I found myself writing the same code over and over each time I started a new project, so I decided to just put that code together into a front-end template that I could reuse as I please. I decided to put it up on <a href="https://github.com/poopsplat/starthere">Github</a> so that anyone else that might need a place to start could use it as they please.

	      It uses <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a> with <a href="http://compass-style.org">Compass</a>, as well as <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt.js</a>, <a href="http://retina.js">Retina.js</a>, and set up for use with <a href="http://modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> (although there is nothing in the project itself that uses jQuery).
